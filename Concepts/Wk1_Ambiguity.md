## Lecture 1 - Course Overview & Types of Ambiguity (01/04/2021)


### Ambiguity
1. Reference ambiguity
e.g, "I dropped the hammer on the table. It shattered."
2. Lexical ambiguity
e.g., "The dog's pen was full of blue ink."
3. Scope ambiguity
e.g., "If three relatives die, I will inherit a house."

### Why Deep Learning?
- Deep Learning as a tool to decouple the ambiguities.
- Word2Vec is a representation schema used for parsing words.
