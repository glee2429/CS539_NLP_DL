## CS540 W21 NLP + DL
### Week 2: Deep Learning 

### What is DL? 
Simply put, DL is a function that f:X->Y from model class F that best approximates g: X->Y (usually unnown but have samples from it) given a dataset D of observations of g.

#### Approximation & types of erros 
1. Modeling error
2. Estimation error
3. Optimization Error

#### How does DL work in each case of error?
1. They make a massive function class. 
2. Also, we use large datasets, well-matched architectures, and early stopping. 
3. Surprisingly low with SGD, the reason is unknown. --> We just got lucky!
